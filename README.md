## Dagster vs Airflow ##

The code for a blog post describing the difference between Apache Airflow and
Dagster as data pipeline and orchestration tools.

See blog post for complete details.

This code is just an example Pipeline written for both Airflow and Dagster to
be able to compare between the two systems.

Both read from the sample CSV file and do simple transforms.
